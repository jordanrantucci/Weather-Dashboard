# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This is a CWRU coding bootcamp assignement for a Weather Dashboard.  This homework shows that the student is able to link an API and call upon it to generate and append the information from it.  API's are used to make requests and access data and apply them functionally to a web page.  

Completion of this homework will show that the student is able to build a weather dashboard that will run in a browser and work functionally by displaying updated HTML and styled CSS.  The project uses JQuery to add elements to the HTML.  The homework portrays the ability to write functions, for loops, if then statments etc. to create the page.  The student will also have to store information locally.

## User Story

```
This app would be usefull for someone that was potentially traveling to a city and wanted to get the upcoming weather forecast.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

I was not able to complete this portion of the homework by making the cities clickable
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
I was able to reopen the dashboard and see the previous searched city, however the content needs to be cleared upon inspection.
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```
